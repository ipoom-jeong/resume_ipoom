abstract: "Mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablet PCs, have been widely
  used in everyday life. These devices are required to provide high performance
  for better user experience. Thereby, Application Processors (APs) equipped in
  mobile devices consist of a number of out-of-order superscalar cores that
  execute programs in a high performance. On the other hand, out-of-order cores
  consume much more power than in-order cores, due to their capability for
  dynamic scheduling of instructions. Dynamic instruction scheduling requires
  complex and expensive logics, such as instruction queue and wakeup/select
  logic. These structures consume more than 40% of total power dissipation of
  the out-of-order core. To address this problem, we propose Parallel In-Order
  Execution Architecture by introducing Parallel In-order eXecution Units
  (PIXU). In our design, ready-to-execute instructions are immediately issued to
  PIXU without dynamic scheduling but by referring simple table, namely Register
  Status Table (RST). Our design significantly depletes the wakeup and selection
  operation counts, which results in the improvement of overall energy
  efficiency. Consequently, our evaluation shows that our design increases the
  performance by 13% while reducing energy consumption to 90% with slight area
  overhead of 3.8% (PIXU: 2.0%, RST: 1.8%) of total area."
