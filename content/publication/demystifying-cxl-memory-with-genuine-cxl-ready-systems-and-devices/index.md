abstract: The high demand for memory capacity in modern datacenters has led to
  multiple lines of innovation in memory expansion and disaggregation. One such
  effort is Compute eXpress Link (CXL)-based memory expansion, which has gained
  significant attention. To better leverage CXL memory, researchers have built
  several emulation and experimental platforms to study its behavior and
  characteristics. However, due to the lack of commercial hardware supporting
  CXL memory, the full picture of its capabilities may still be unclear to the
  community. In this work, we explore CXL memory's performance characterization
  on a state-of-the-art experimental platform. First, we study the basic
  performance characteristics of CXL memory using our proposed microbenchmark.
  Based on our observations and comparisons to standard DRAM connected to local
  and remote NUMA nodes, we also study the impact of CXL memory on end-to-end
  applications with different offloading and interleaving policies. Finally, we
  provide several guidelines for future programmers to realized the full
  potential of CXL memory.
