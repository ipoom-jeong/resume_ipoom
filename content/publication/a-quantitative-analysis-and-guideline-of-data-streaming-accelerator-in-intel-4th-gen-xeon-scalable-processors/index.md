abstract: As semiconductor power density is no longer constant with the
  technology process scaling down, modern CPUs are integrating capable data
  accelerators on chip, aiming to improve performance and efficiency for a wide
  range of applications and usages. One such accelerator is the Intel Data
  Streaming Accelerator (DSA) introduced in Intel 4th Generation Xeon Scalable
  CPUs (Sapphire Rapids). DSA targets data movement operations in memory that
  are common sources of overhead in datacenter workloads and infrastructure. In
  addition, it becomes much more versatile by supporting a wider range of
  operations on streaming data, such as CRC32 calculations, delta record
  creation/merging, and data integrity field (DIF) operations. This paper sets
  out to introduce the latest features supported by DSA, deep-dive into its
  versatility, and analyze its throughput benefits through a comprehensive
  evaluation. Along with the analysis of its characteristics, and the rich
  software ecosystem of DSA, we summarize several insights and guidelines for
  the programmer to make the most out of DSA, and use an in-depth case study of
  DPDK Vhost to demonstrate how these guidelines benefit a real application.
