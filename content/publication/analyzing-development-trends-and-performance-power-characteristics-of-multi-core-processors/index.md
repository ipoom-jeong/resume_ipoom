abstract: This paper analyzes various multi-core architectures that have been
  proposed for decades to increase the performance or power efficiency of
  processors. First, we investigate representatives of each type of multi-core
  architecture in detail. Then, we estimate the performance and power efficiency
  by modeling them into a cycle-accurate simulator. As a result, we conclude
  that each type of architecture shows different characteristics on the
  perspective of optimization point. Therefore, architects need to consider
  their purpose of designing processors, such as target applications,
  high-performance computing, and low-power computing.
