  Recent GPUs provisioned with large register files

  cannot fully utilize the bandwidth between the register files

  and execution pipelines, as the current policy for allocating

  operand collectors defers the register file accesses until all the

  source operands become ready. To tackle this issue, this paper

  introduces a new operand collector allocation mechanism called

  Triple-A. Triple-A comprises four key operations. First, Triple-A

  proactively allocates an operand collector to a warp instruction

  even if one of its source operands is not yet ready, taking

  advantage of GPUsâ€™ in-order execution. Second, a computation

  result can be directly forwarded to an early allocated operand

  collector along with a data dependence, reducing operand loading

  time from the register files. Third, Triple-A bypasses register

  file write operations if the forwarded data is not consumed

  by any other instruction. Lastly, the early allocation is further

  enhanced with latency-aware optimization, alleviating the potential performance degradation caused by allocating operand

  collectors aggressively. Together, these techniques synergistically

  improve the register bank utilization, demonstrating a 14.1%

  improvement in performance and an 11.8% reduction in register

  file energy consumption compared to the state-of-the-art GPUs.
