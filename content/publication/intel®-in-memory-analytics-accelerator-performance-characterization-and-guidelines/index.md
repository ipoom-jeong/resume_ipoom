abstract: "The rapid advancements in CPU performance have
slowed due to the end of Dennard scaling and the exponential
growth of data, making it increasingly difficult to sustain previous
progress rates. As a result, there is a growing trend of offloading
frequently used operations to hardware accelerators to enhance
application performance while reducing CPU cycle consumption.
In line with this trend, Intel introduced the In-Memory Analytics
Accelerator (IAA) as an on-chip accelerator in its 4th-generation
Xeon® Scalable CPUs (Sapphire Rapids). IAA is designed to
offload common big data and in-memory analytics operations
from CPUs, accelerating query processing tasks such as CRC64,
expand, extract, scan, and select, in addition to (de)compression
functions. As IAA is integrated with CPUs as an on-chip
accelerator, it can directly access the CPU’s cache and memory
in a cache-coherent manner, offering low latency and power
consumption with reduced programming complexity compared
to off-chip accelerators. In this paper, we first introduce the
hardware and software architectures of IAA, highlighting its
latest features. We then evaluate IAA’s performance using various
microbenchmarks and widely used analytics applications, including Pandas, Citus, and Clickhouse. Finally, based on our findings,
we provide guidelines for effectively utilizing and optimizing IAA
for analytics applications."
