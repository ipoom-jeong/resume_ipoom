abstract: Energy efficiency has become an important issue in modern
  microprocessor designs. In this paper, we propose a core microarchitecture
  that exploits high energy efficiency by pushing in-order execution capability
  into traditional out-of-order execution models and selectively activating
  in-order execution resources through power-gating. The proposed architecture
  is motivated by the fact that existing Front-end Execution Architecture (FXA)
  is not always energy-efficient because in-order execution resources are turned
  on every time, even though it is not necessary. Compared to the FXA, our
  design shows lower energy consumption on in-order execution resources by 80%,
  while performance degradation is less than 1%.
