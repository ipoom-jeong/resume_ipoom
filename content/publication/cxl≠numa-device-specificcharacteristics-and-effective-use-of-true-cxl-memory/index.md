summary: In this work, we evaluate true CXL-ready systems based on the latest
  4th-generation Intel Xeon CPU with three CXL memory devices from different
  manufacturers, which divulges important differences between emulated and true
  CXL memory devices. Based on these observations, we propose a CXL-memory-aware
  dynamic page allocation policy, Caption, to use CXL memory more efficiently.
